		<h2>
			About Jacob Emory
		</h2>

		<p>
			Since high school I have been exploring and accessing my interests. I’ve taken a few classes, worked, and spent a lot of time thinking about what I want to do with my life. I’ve developed a real love for photography. In fact, you can see some of my work in the images here on my web site. I’ve also come back to computer programming and software development an interest that started with an AP Computer Science Class my junior year of high school. I have recognized my talent in this field and am now in the process of honing skills and learning new languages. My goal is to find a position with a small to mid-sized innovative company whose environment encourages growth and creativity.
